The paper presents a fully convolutional neural network model for semantic pixel-wise segmentation. In this paper, we propose a crop-weed classification system for potato which is row vegetation the model incorporates spatial information by considering image sequences. Exploiting the crop arrangement information that is observed from the image sequences enables our system to robustly estimate into crop and weed, i.e., a semantic segmentation. After classifying the contours in the captured image by the robot, the robotic cutter removes the weed. We provide a thorough experimental evaluation, which shows that our system generalizes well to previously unseen fields under varying environmental conditions such as variation in light and alignment a key capability to actually use such systems in precision farming. We provide a robust system that classifies best compared to the already existing systems which focus on image processing and supervised learning algorithms. The location of the weed is found through image processing and then weed cutter reaches the desired coordinate and defoliate the unwanted plant.
